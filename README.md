# Iris Flower Classification Project

**Introduction:**

Classification of Iris flowers based on their botanical features is a classification problem in the field of machine learning. The Iris dataset, comprising measurements of sepal and petal dimensions of three Iris flower species, serves as a benchmark for introductory classification tasks. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on these measurements.

**Problem Statement:**

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on sepal and petal measurements. Using the dataset which includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, the model will learn to distinguish between the different species. 

**Dataset:**

The Dataset used for this Project has around 150 Records and has the following variables:

•	Id: A unique identifier for each sample in the dataset.

•	SepalLengthCm: The length of the sepal of the iris flower in centimeters.

•	SepalWidthCm: The width of the sepal of the iris flower in centimeters.

•	PetalLengthCm: The length of the petal of the iris flower in centimeters.

•	PetalWidthCm: The width of the petal of the iris flower in centimeters.

•	Species: The species of the iris flower. This is the target variable and can be one of the three species: 'setosa', 'versicolor', or 'virginica'. (Target Variable)

**Project Description:**

• Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze insights and patterns in the Iris Flower Dataset.

• Developed Machine Learning Models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Complement Naive Bayes.

• Implemented Cross-Validation to improve the model performance.

• Employed Accuracy as the Evaluation Metric.


**Observation:**

•	SepalWidth has some Outliers in our Dataset

•	SepalWidth (With -0.11) has more negative correlation, when compared to other variables

•	Achieved an Accuracy of 0.97 with Logistic Regression Model
